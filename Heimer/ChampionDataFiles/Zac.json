Cannot be interacted with for the first 0.25 seconds (except during  Let's Bounce!).\nUncontestable: They will fall to the ground near Zac and can be picked up immediately (version used by default).\nZac's  untargetability upon triggering Cell Divison does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\n Guardian Angel and  Chronoshift will take precedence over Cell Division.\n Spirit Visage and  Heal Power increases the healing of both chunks and bloblets.\n Ryze's  Realm Warp is able to individually teleport Zac or his bloblets during Cell Division.\nIf Zac is transported to a new location before the bloblets landed, they will travel to form at his new position, adjusting their speed accordingly. If Cell Division's duration permits during this time, Zac will be revived even if the bloblets fail to recombine.\nCell Division's bloblets can be targeted by  Teleport and  Syndra's  Force of Will.\nOther bloblets are not interrupted by the conditions above and will continue to recombine instinctively.\nZac's health when the bloblets are sent out is set to what it would be if all bloblets recombined, and is actively updated when the bloblets take damage.\nIf Zac's health is higher than it is supposed to be when the bloblets converge on him, his health will be set to the correct value.",
