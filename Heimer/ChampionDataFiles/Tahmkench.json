Allies become untargetable on-cast.\nDevour counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and stacking  Force Pulse.\nDetonating the ability early for  Regurgitate does not.\nIf the displacement of the target entering Tahm Kench's belly is interrupted, the target is swallowed immediately.\nDevour's initial  suppression is separate from the one that lasts while swallowed.\n Cleansing the initial one will also remove the displacement of entering the belly.\nDevour will remove  airborne effects from the target upon entering Tahm Kench's belly.\nSwallowed non-champions cannot be reduced below  1 health.\nDevour cannot be used on allies that are  channeling.\nDevour cannot be cast on units that are  displacement immune.\nDevour cannot be cast on  Effigies.\nDevour's cast will cancel if the target becomes  displacement immune during the cast time. The cooldown will be refunded if this occurs.\nThe same also happens if they become  immune to crowd control, although the cooldown is not refunded.\nThe swallowed target will become free if Tahm Kench enters or leaves the  Realm of Death or is teleported by  Realm Warp.\nTahm Kench cannot channel  Recall during Devour.\nSwallowed enemy champions will receive Regurgitate's damage regardless of how they leave Tahm Kench's belly.\nDevour is canceled if the target dies or enters the  Realm of Death during the cast time. It does not go on  cooldown nor expend  mana.\nThe  self-slow is affected by  slow resist.\nDevour will prioritize champions over other units.\nIf champions stay on top of each other it will prioritize those who stay beneath.\nDevour cannot be used on  post-death forms such as  Glory in Death or on targets that are already being devoured by another Tahm Kench.\nDevour cannot be cast on  Zac's  bloblets.\nDevour will not end persistent area-of-effect abilities early (e.g.  Crowstorm,  Slicing Maelstrom,  Inferno Trigger) nor non-channeled ones (e.g.  Center of the Universe).",
