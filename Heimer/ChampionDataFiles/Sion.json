        "notes": "Glory in Death is currently the only targetable  zombie state.\nUpon Death, Sion will drop non-permanent status effects (buffs and debuffs) that do not inherently persist through death before transitioning into Glory in Death:\nThese effects include undisplayed statuses, for example the 'already stunned by this'-flag of  Veigar's  Event Horizon or  Viktor's  Gravity Field.\nSome item passives do not persist through death and will be lost for the initial few seconds of Glory in Death.\nAn example for a debuff that does persist through death is  Brand's  Blaze.\nGlory in Death will still trigger if Sion is killed by the  Nexus Obelisk.\nUpon death, the current cooldowns of Sion's  summoner spells are increased to 4 seconds. Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns or after a lock-out effect (excluding  crowd control except  stasis) unlocks them.\n Resurrection buffs always take priority over Glory in Death.\nSion's death timer starts ticking when he first  dies and not when Glory in Death's duration ends.\nIf Sion lives longer than his death timer lasts for, he will not revive until Glory in Death has ended. When it has ended, he will revive instantly, which can result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\nGlory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion, such as with  Test of Spirit.\nGlory in Death's  untargetability from the  stasis does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nProjectiles created while while Sion is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies.\nAt the start of Glory in Death, Sion's  mana drops to 0, but his  mana regeneration will remain in effect.\nDuring Glory in Death Sion:\nHas all sources of  healing reduced by 100% with the exception of  life steal and  spell vamp.\nThis includes item passives such as  Blade of the Ruined King's special lifesteal-affected on-hit, as well as runes such as  Ravenous Hunter.\n Spirit Visage's unique passive (specifically before V10.23) is unaffected and furthermore 'lowers' this reduction to 70% for health regeneration due to the way it factors in.\nCan:\n Critically strike.\nUse all item actives, except  Refillable Potion and  Corrupting Potion.\nUse  Magical Journey.\nBe targeted by  Stand United.\nBe dragged and carried by  Fate's Call.\nSion will not lose health during this time.\nCannot:\nChannel  Recall.\nEnter  resurrection (e.g. via  Guardian Angel).\nUse  summoner spells.\nTake  Abyssal Voyage nor  Dark Passage.\nBe targeted by  Chronoshift,  Devour, nor  Umbral Trespass.\nHe cannot be targeted by  Fate's Call while in the  stasis portion of Glory in Death (if he does, by any circumstance, he will emerge immediately).\nBe taken into the  Realm of Death.\nBe affected by  Fear Beyond Death (recast),  Curse of the Black Mist, nor  Lamb's Respite.\nHave his spirit be pulled by  Test of Spirit.\nPick up the  Eye of the Herald.\nTake the Catapult.\nTrying to cast item actives during the initial stasis will buffer their casts instead, unless Sion issues another command before being able to act again.\nException:  Quicksilver can be used during the  stasis after death.\nSion's attack speed during Glory in Death is fixed at 1.75 and it's unaffected by attack speed bonuses and  cripples for the duration.\nBuffs that allow for the normal 2.5 attack speed cap to be surpassed, such as  Lethal Tempo and  Hail of Blades, will also break the upper limit of the 1.75 cap, but not the lower one. This means that while these buffs are active, Sion can exceed 1.75 attack speed, but cannot fall below it.\nAfter the effect ends, the attack speed cap will not revert to 1.75 but to 2.5. However Sion will still not be able to go below 1.75 attack speed.\nBuffs from jungle monsters Sion gains during Glory in Death ( Crest of Cinders,  Crest of Insight) will not be lost once the duration ends.\nBy surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will have suffered 36.4k \u2212 345.5k (based on level) in health costs.\nAfter Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain unit collision despite being dead on the ground.\nEven though its visuals are present,  Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death.\nThe effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by  healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.\nGlory in Death's on-hit effect also applies against structures other than  turrets. *",

White cone has a radius of 720, while yellow cone has a radius of 1550.  \nSion himself remains  locked out of all actions for 0.25 seconds when releasing Decimating Smash.\nTrying to cast  Soul Furnace will buffer the cast until Sion is no longer locked out or otherwise prevented from casting it, while  Roar of the Slayer and  Unstoppable Onslaught will not buffer.\n Displacement immunity will prevent both the knock up and the stun.\nSince the  stun duration is longer than the  airborne duration, and both start at the same time,  Tenacity is still fully effective against Decimating Smash up to a cap.\nThis virtual cap is 60%-55.5%  Tenacity based on channel time beyond 1 second. Every value below this cap will lower the CC duration with no diminished returns.\nA flash of the axe and change in brightness of the indicator on the ground indicates when the 1 second time frame is reached.\nThe damage of Decimating Smash is calculated when it is released. Gaining AD or upgrading the ability during its channel will update the damage of the coming hit.\nEven though the cooldown starts when the ability is released, it will not be changed by gaining or losing CDR, or upgrading the ability, during the cast time.\nThe indicator is visible to the enemy only if they  see Sion himself.\nIf the channel is released before 1 second, enemies may see a particle at the far end of the hitbox, if it itself isn't outside of their  vision.\nIf the channel is released after 1 second, the only remaining indication is the visual effects and audio that plays on any units the spell strikes (these play on-target), provided the enemy does have  vision on those.\nForced movement without a  stun component (or the stun being  cleansed previously) will not stop Sion from starting or continuing to channel. Its direction will not change with Sion's travel, however the location will update with him.\nThe location of the indicator updates at the beginning of the ability, at 1 second and at release.\nThe indicator of the ability is slightly shorter at its front than the hitbox of the ability is for  Original Sion,  Mecha Zero Sion and related skins and chromas, while on  Worldbreaker Sion, the indicator is slightly thinner at the front than the hitbox is, instead.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Sion is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nCharge channel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Soul Furnace and its  recast are usable.

        "notes": "When Sion casts Unstoppable Onslaught a global warning can be heard.\nUnstoppable Onslaught does not apply the knock up nor stun to enemies from slamming on collision with terrain.\nUnstoppable Onslaught does not  knock up non-champions hit by the charge.*\nUnstoppable Onslaught can be activated twice or held down and released on both normal cast and quick cast. There is no other difference between normal cast and quick cast for this ability, either.\nThe initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as Spellblade and stacking  Force Pulse.\nThe recast does not.\nAn enemy can only be affected by Unstoppable Onslaught once every 1 second.\nAfter reaching maximum damage and stun duration (at 3 seconds) Sion will transition from using his haste animation to his unique charging one.\nReaching the threshold on  Mecha Zero Sion changes his particle effects instead, most notably the 'Boosters' behind the vehicle.\nThe turning angle is not based on time and can easily be seen in practice when a Sion charges in-place due to bugs.\n Nami's  Surging Tides is the only known effect that can affect Sion's movement speed during the charge and that can place him above the normal MS value. However, without further multipliers, surpassing the 950 movement speed cap will require  Nami to have over 2150 ability power.\nSion does not always crash with terrain immediately upon touching it, enabling the player to turn beyond his maximum turning angle.\nCasting the ability at point blank of a terrain will most often automatically change the charge's direction.\nThis is not usually possible with player-generated terrain.\nUnstoppable Onslaught cannot charge through but can leap over player-created terrain (i.e  Crystallize).\nSion loses the  crowd control immunity after finishing the  leap.\nSion is not immune to  crowd control applied by his allies during Unstoppable Onslaught. For example, a  Blast Cone triggered by an ally will cause the  channel to be  interrupted.\nAn allied  Bard's  Tempered Fate will be resisted however.\nIf it hits Sion during the 0.05-second delay before he starts the channel, he will not resist the effect and will initiate the slam immediately while in  stasis.\nSion is immune to the  Realm of Death for 2 seconds after completing the slam after the channel ends.*\nUnstoppable Onslaught cannot strike the same non-champion twice in less than 1 second.\n \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc06 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc11 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc13  The distance between Sion's center and the center of the ground slam scales slightly with movement speed. This is suspected because running into a wall within half a second of charge time after starting at multiple thousands of movement speed shows a considerable difference, however this could also be due to a bug.\n \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc06 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc11 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc13  The leap appears to always have the same speed regardless of Sion's, at roughly 750.\nMoving the cursor onto HUD elements (e.g mini map / champion portraits) does not jeopardize the cast and steering of Unstoppable Onslaught. The targeting will act as if the ground was targeted below the display element.\nEven though the cooldown of Unstoppable Onslaught starts at the end of the effect, gaining or losing ability haste, or upgrading the ability during the effect, will not change the resuming cooldown.\n Removing the  airborne before 0.5 seconds will not prevent the  stun from being applied.\nPreventing the  airborne from being applied (i.e  unstoppability) also prevents the  stun.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Sion is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Soul Furnace and its  recast are usable.  Decimating Smash and  Roar of the Slayer are disabled. This ability recasts to end channel.\n\n\nMovement\n\nAllowed, but cannot input movement commands.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash  Mark  Dash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath\n\nIf Unstoppable Onslaught's channel is interrupted despite the immunity to crowd control or  Decimating Smash is cast within 0.25 seconds after starting the charge, it will also initiate the leap. If the channel ends due to collision or death, there is no  leap and the effect occurs immediately.",
