If Illaoi attack commands and then casts Harsh Lesson, she will use the close range Harsh Lesson even if the target is beyond her melee range.\nStarting the attack before triggering  Guardian Angel's passive and hitting while she's in it will not cause the Tentacles to slam.\nStarting the attack before the target becomes  untargetable will still cause the Tentacles to slam the target.\nDoes trigger  Hail of Blades.\nTriggers  Energized effects on-hit.\nIf the empowered attack duration ends during the attack animation, the attack won't be empowered.\nThe dash range ability:\nDoes not have an uncancelable windup, meaning effects that can interrupt the dash will cancel the attack and put the ability on cooldown.  Flash and  Zhonya's Hourglass cannot be used during the dash.\nCan be cast but cannot be used while  grounded or  rooted because Illaoi loses the  bonus attack range.\nStarting the attack before the target becomes  untargetable will not make Tentacles slam.\nDoes not trigger  Hail of Blades.\nTriggers  Energized effects during the jump.\nHaving enough attack speed will perform an unusual dunk.\nHaving increased size will increase the range of her Harsh Lesson but the indicator range will not change.\nIf the empowered attack duration ends during the dash, the buff will linger until the attack has finished.\n Spell shields will not prevent the Tentacle slam, unless a dash range Harsh Lesson has been used.\nParries ( dodge,  block,  blind) will block the damage and will not trigger  Tentacle slams, with the exception of:\n Block when using a close range Harsh Lesson, which triggers  Tentacle slams.\n Blind when using a dash range Harsh Lesson, which triggers  Tentacle slams.\nIf the target dies at the moment Harsh Lesson hits the target, it will be consumed and put on cooldown, without making Tentacles slam.\nThe Tentacle attacking because of Harsh Lesson is considered to be part of it, and thus will not grant additional stacks of  Conqueror,  Electrocute,  Phase Rush and Tribute.\nUsing it together with  Dead Man's Plate will grant an additional stack of  Conqueror.\nHarsh Lesson's bonus damage applies before  Blade of the Ruined King's damage.\nHarsh Lesson triggers  Bone Plating and one of its plates with the same attack.\nAttack moving while charging  Hexflash will delay the attack.",

The Spirit's allies cannot target it.\nSpirits take 50% damage from turrets and do not cause turrets to  Warm Up their attacks.\nSpirits cannot be  healed nor  shielded ( Summon Aery excluded).\nThe Spirit levels up when the Vessel does. Doing so will increase the Spirit's health, armor, and magic resist, and additionally extend its lifetime by 1 second.\nIllaoi cannot cast Test of Spirit again until the Spirit is gone.\nThe Spirit is  untargetable while it is being pulled.\nRedirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage, applying Test of Spirit's damage modifier, and then capping it to the Spirit's current health. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the Vessel.\nIf the Spirit's damage modifier is lower than the Vessel's, it will cause an increase in total redirected damage, else it will cause a decrease.\nIf the Spirit's damage modifier is higher than Test of Spirit's, it will cause an increase in total redirected damage, else it will cause a decrease. The difference in damage is up to a cap.\nIllaoi needs 937.5 / 875 / 812.5 / 750 / 687.5 total AD to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the Spirit's and Vessel's damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's current health as total redirected damage.\nThe damage displayed as being received by the Spirit is not representative of the damage redirected to the Vessel, as the combat text shown adjacent to the Spirit uses the Spirit's resistances.\n Spell shields may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the slow upon becoming a Vessel. Spell shields will not prevent becoming a Vessel or Tentacles from attacking.\nThe spirit pull is not considered a  crowd control effect and will not be blocked by  crowd control immunity, with the exception of  Morgana's  Black Shield.*\nIf the target becomes a Vessel within range of a dormant Tentacle, that Tentacle will skip its first attack.\nThe tentacle model of the first cast is connected to Illaoi's body and will stop moving when Illaoi does (e.g  stasis,  sleep,  airborne). However, the projectile will not, and will be able to hit enemies away from its model position. It will also not be seen by enemies if Illaoi is not  visible, but it will be heard if the tentacle passes through their vision.\nTest of Spirit will fire from wherever Illaoi is at the end of the cast time towards the same pointed location.\nGrabbing the Spirit of a champion that has their resource bar white (i.e  Flow) will make the Spirit's lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear.\nGrabbing the Spirit of a target that is  camouflaged while they are being revealed by a  Control Ward will make the Spirit also invisible.\nOnly Illaoi can see who's been Vesseled, with their model covered in watery effects. The Vessel itself will instead have its screen covered in watery effects.\nThe Vessel status effect is a debuff that doesn't persist through death.\nIf the enemy champion is  resurrecting when the conditions for becoming a Vessel are met, then they will not revive as a Vessel.\nRunes consider the Spirit as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking.\n Predator only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the Spirit (e.g if  Predator would deal 60 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 120 damage).\nTransferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as  Black Cleaver,  Morellonomicon,  Executioner's Calling,  Aspect of the Dragon burn damage.\n \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc06 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc11 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc13 : Healing from  Omnivamp\nTransferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.  Liandry's Anguish,  Phase Rush stacks). These effects are only applied versus the Spirit.\nAttacking the Vessel and its Spirit simultaneously will only apply one stack of  Black Cleaver to the Vessel.\nOnce the Spirit vanishes, whether defeated or not, Illaoi will get 1 creep score in-game (not included in the post-game counter).\nThe Spirit is immune to  stasis (i.e.  Bard's  Tempered Fate).\n Fiora's  Riposte can be used to prevent becoming a Vessel if used before the Spirit is killed or while leaving the tether's range.\n Sion's Spirit cannot be spawned during  Glory in Death. Spirits created before Sion's  zombie state will remain active.\nIf the target that had its Spirit pulled from them is taken into the  Realm of Death, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a Vessel.",
