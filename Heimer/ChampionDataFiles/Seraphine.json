This is increased to 24 Notes on  Hexakill as there is an additional allied champion.\nAt 20 Notes, Seraphine next basic attack will gain  500 bonus attack range.\nHarmony grants Notes even if the ally is  untargetable.\nThe Notes will fire from allies regardless of how far they are away from Seraphine.\nSeraphine gains a faint blue attack range indicator when there are Notes present.\nNotes do not discharge when attacking  wards, allowing Seraphine to attack them from increased range multiple times.\nOther Details:\n\nSeraphine, while alive, will play music if there is at least one ally champion nearby.\nThis is audible to Seraphine and all allied champions that are in range of Harmony, indicative of if they can receive a Note or not.",
