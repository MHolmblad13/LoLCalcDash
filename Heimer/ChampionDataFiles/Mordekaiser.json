Mordekaiser will still get the usual amount of maximum health.\nUnlike the other stats, Mordekaiser does not steal enemy total size; instead he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).\nMordekaiser grows in size over 0.25 seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over 0.25 seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over 0.25 seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.\nEntering or leaving the Death Realm will cause all targeted  projectiles to be  destroyed.\nThe transition in and out of the Death Realm doesn't interrupt  channels.\nThe only exception is  Grand Starfall, which will be interrupted when that ability's caster enters the Realm of Death.\nThe boundaries are not considered terrain ( Unstoppable Onslaught exception), and enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside.\n Dashes,  blinks,  displacements and other forms of movement will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\nMultiple Death Realms (possible through a  hijacked Realm of Death or if multiple Mordekaisers are in the same match) spawned will exist in the same dimension, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\n Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated.\nAn active  Assault and Battery on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nRealm of Death will not be dispelled if either of the two affected champions enter  resurrection after taking lethal damage. It is dispelled if the target enters a  zombie state.\nRealm of Death can be dispelled (excluding death and duration) if:\nThe target uses a  cleansing effect, with the exceptions of  Cleanse,  Mikael's Blessing, and  Kled's  Dismount.\n Yone's  Soul Unbound recast is disabled while he is in the Realm of Death.\nMordekaiser or the target cast another Realm of Death. The affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.\nAny active  tether effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm will be broken (unless the tether is between those two).\nStructures exist in all realms at the same time.  Turrets will behave normally as if all units were in the same realm.\nThe allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the players have no  vision of them.\nRealm of Death's interactions with other elements/abilities:\n Brushes will maintain their presence between realms.\nSwitching realms detaches all  attached champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.\n The Hextech Ultimatum, catching a  Spinning Axe,  Timewinder,  Parallel Convergence,  Null Zone,  Twisted Advance,  Pix,  Worked Grounds,  Gravity Field,  Satchel Charge,  Rift Scuttler's  Speed Shrine,  Statikk Shiv and gaining  Zeke's Convergence  area of effect are exceptions and may still take effect between dimensions if the conditions are valid.\nEffects such as  Requiem,  Absolute Zero,  Grand Starfall and  Final Spark will only deal damage to enemies of the dimension they're in at time of cast. Ending the channel or cast time while inside another dimension will not do damage to nearby enemies.\nUnits that enter the realm while taking  Bard's  Magical Journey will be able to bypass the borders.*\nAny spawned terrain while in the Death Realm will remain inside until expired. They will not be destroyed.\n Kindred's  Lamb's Respite is one of many area of effect abilities that will not take presence between realms.\n Shuriken Flip may be re-cast inside the Death Realm even if its target is outside it, but  Akali will stop dashing upon colliding with the boundary.\nThe target of  Devour will immediately leave  Tahm Kench's belly when he enters or leaves the Realm of Death.\n Feathers cannot be interacted with between realms by  Xayah ( Bladecaller will not call feathers in the other realm towards her).\n Umbral Trespass will end prematurely if the Death Realm ends while  Kayn is attached.\n Weaver's Wall is interrupted both when  Taliyah enters the Realm of Death and leaves it.\n Fear Beyond Death may not be re-cast while his victim is not in the same realm as him, but an already chained foe will still continue to be reeled in and executed. The  fear is cast in the realm Urgot is in.\n Mist Wraiths will spawn between realms and can be interacted with by  Viego.  Harrowed Path will take presence between realms.\n Zed's  Shadows will take presence between realms.\n Void Shift dispels from Realm of Death's  slow, making it vulnerable to the Death Realm.\n Ball will instantly return back to Orianna if she's sent to another dimension.\n Eye of the Herald and  Teleport are disabled while in the Realm of Death.\nControllable pets and decoys can still be commanded between realms.\nJungle plants ( Blast Cone,  Honeyfruit,  Scryer's Bloom) will not take presence between realms.\n Nocturne's  Paranoia only applies  nearsight to enemy champions in the same dimension as him.\nThe player's screen will still change in color however.\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Turbo Chemtank  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Gargoyle Stoneplate  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite  Flash\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",
