If the empowered attack had already gone off, the knock up will not be resisted, thus interrupting the target's actions.*\nIt will trigger against  crowd control immune targets.\nThe knock up will however be partially resisted against  Black Shield; only the disabling portion (airborne debuff) will be negated but not the displacement (forced movement).*\nThe knock up will be resisted by  Riposte, but the ability does not trigger its on- immobilization effect.*\nThe empowered attack will not apply the knock up against  suspended enemies.\nThe empowered attack will only apply the knock up if the target is still  immobilized or  airborne upon being hit. It will not apply if they are no longer disabled when hit.\nThe empowered attack cannot be used against a target with a  spell shield.\nThe application of the knock up can occur on any of the missiles of the empowered attack if it had not already occurred on the first missile.\nA missile that is parried by  Riposte or is  dodged,  blocked, or missed while Samira is  blinded cannot apply the knock up.\nWhile  grounded or  rooted, Samira cannot  dash into range to use the empowered attack. She can only use it if her target is within her  attack range while under this condition.\nThe on-target cooldown will apply even if the empowered attack is parried.\nThe empowered attack rolls  critical strike for each shot of the flurry.\nThe bonus magic damage dealt with the blade is  default damage. The empowered attack is first 1 instance of  basic damage and then 5 instances of  default damage.\nThe bonus damage does not apply to structures.\nThe empowered attack is unaffected by  attack speed modifiers.\n Guinsoo's Rageblade's Phantom Hit and  Runaan's Hurricane's bolts will not apply the bonus magic damage, since it is  on-hit of specifically the melee attack casts.\nAttacks with the gun and blade do not count as different attacks for stacking Style.\nBasic attacks using the blade are still classified as  ranged.\nThe melee attack's range condition is unaffected by  attack range modifiers (e.g.  Rapid Firecannon).\nBlade range is calculated edge-to-edge just like basic attack ranges are, hence both Samira gaining bonus size or her target increases the total distance at which Samira can attack them with the blade.\nSince the  knock up requires an exterior source to  immobilize the enemy,  Aftershock will be swapped with  Grasp of the Undying for Samira at the start of the game.\nAbilities blocked by  spell shields will still grant Samira Style stacks.\nSamira still gains Style stacks from damaging attacks and abilities landed against  clones.",
