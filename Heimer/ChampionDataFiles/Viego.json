They will continue ticking down in the background.\nThe passive cooldowns of items are shared between Viego's and the possessed champion's.\nOnce possession ends, Viego returns to his normal state and certain effects gained from the possessed champion's abilities will be immediately removed.\nSome buffs will be kept and some buffs will be lost.\nViego will almost always keep  shields and  spell shields.\nPassive effects will be lost by default, as Viego no longer has their abilities.\n Channeled abilities maintained will be interrupted.\nToggled abilities will be automatically toggled off.\nViego retains his own summoner spells, trinket item, and runes during possession.\nViego can possess a Mist Wraith while already under possession. Doing so discards his current possession when the windup completes.\nMist Wraiths will not spawn while Viego is dead.\nSovereign's Domination will not summon a Mist Wraith from  clones.\nThe possession will not expire while Viego is in a  zombie state.\nWhile in a zombie state,  Heartbreaker is disabled.\nThe possession will not end prematurely if Viego enters  resurrection.\nThe possession will acquire the basic abilities of shapeshifting champions (e.g.  Elise's  Spider Form / Human Form,  Jayce's  Transform Mercury Cannon /  Transform Mercury Hammer, and  Nidalee's  Aspect of the Cougar) based on which form they died as.\nMist Wraiths are considered  clones and can only be targeted by Viego.\nIf Viego possesses an enemy champion who owns  Dark Seal or  Mejai's Soulstealer, he will gain their Glory stacks for the possession.\nIf Viego possesses an enemy champion who owns  Cull, killing minions will grant the extra gold. It will however not count towards his  Cull if he owns one.\n \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc06 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc11 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc13  Do the stacks remain the same upon possessing the same enemy multiple times or does Viego get the same amount of Cull stacks that the enemy had? Can he get the  +350 extra gold upon completing the Cull?\nIf Viego possesses an enemy champion who owns  Relic Shield,  Steel Shoulderguards,  Spellthief's Edge, or  Spectral Sickle, the gold gained from using any one of the items will also count towards Viego's own Quest.\nIf Viego possesses an enemy champion who owns  Tear of the Goddess, the stacks it has will be transferred to his  Tear of the Goddess if he owns one.",
