For example, if a stack is acquired while Kayle has  100 ability power, it will grant  7% attack speed. If an additional  100 ability power is gained immediately afterwards (for a total of  200), the next stack will grant  8%. If all ability power is then immediately lost, the next stack will only grant  6%.\nIf Kayle is in her attack animation after the stacks expire, she gains another 0.5 seconds to refresh/stack  Zeal.\nArisen\n\nBasic attacks within  175 will still use Kayle's melee basic attack animations and do not utilize  projectiles.\nThey are still classified as  ranged attacks.\nDue to this fact, projectile blocking effects cannot intercept basic attacks while Kayle's target is within her \"melee\" range.\nAflame\n\nBasic attacks against structures do not trigger fire waves.\nWhile at 4 stacks of  Zeal, the next  on-attack reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by Aflame, releasing the first fire wave.\nTranscendent\n\n Zeal and  Exalted buffs swapped to a new buff that grants the benefit of both and it is not visible on Kayle's HUD.\nThe attack speed no longer needs to be stacked up and will be always on maximum value.\nThis buff also updates its attack speed value whenever a stat update happens and ability power is changed. However, some sources of ability power are no longer tracked, unlike with  Zeal. The following sources becomes invalid:\nRunes\n Infernal Might\n Yuumi's  You and Me!\n Staff of Flowing Water\nFire Waves Details\n\n     Hitboxes shows by a graph side by side.   A wave consists of three projectiles for the hitbox and a fourth for visuals.\nThe hitbox projectiles spawn 75 units behind Kayle, travel through her, and are destroyed once they've traveled 850 units. Their technical details are:\nRange:  850 (755 effective)\nWidth:  200\nProjectile Speed: 2800\nAngle: 18\u00b0 (left and right at 9\u00b0 to their side, respectively)\n Projectile blocking effects can block each projectile individually.\nIt is possible to block the visuals, but still get hit by an unblocked \"invisible\" hitbox projectile.\nHitting an enemy with multiple projectiles of the same wave will not increase the damage dealt.\nFire waves roll  critical strike chance on each target hit individually.\nA known issue is that despite dealing  area spell damage the fire wave does not:\nconsume Mana Charge from  Tear of the Goddess and its upgrades,\nand apply  Muramana's Shock.\nInteractions & Other\n\nBoth the stacking and launching a fire wave is an  on-attack effect that is triggered whenever Kayle completes her attack windup.\nThe fire wave shares cast instance with the triggering basic attack.\nThe amount of  Conqueror stacks gained will be 1 if the basic attack deals damage first or 2 if the wave does so.\nKeep in mind that it's still two damage instances. If one triggers  Bone Plating, the other's damage will be blocked.\nBecause Kayle is both a  melee and  ranged champion, she can purchase both ranged and melee exclusive items at anytime, but their effects will function depending on her current range type; the same principle also applies to runes.\nWaves are fired in the direction that Kayle is facing. Changing that during the early animation via  Flash will also change the direction of the wave.\nEach ascension has an unique animation and a voice line. (See: Kayle's quotes)\nThe ascensions' animation will override the current one, but it does not cancel Kayle's current action, nor her previous orders.",

This is calculated pre-mitigation, or before resistances and reductions are taken into account.\nInteractions & Other\n\n Rapid Firecannon's Energized behaves strangely with the set basic attack range, causing it to jump in value within a short period.\nBefore Transcended: When the cast starts, the range changes from  400 to  337, then after the cast end, it changes from  612 to  675 (actual attack range while Energized).\nAfter Transcended: The values are the same after the cast starts, but changes after the cast end, going from  662 to  725 range (attack range while Energized and Transcended).\nGaining Energized during the cast time will cause the range to jump between values, averaged around  540.\nThe  invulnerability can be tracked on the HUD as a buff called  Intervention.",
