This does not occur if Kayn is in the process of emerging from the target.\nIf those same conditions occur before the attachment, Kayn will reappear at the target's location after completing the dash. There is no compensation if this happens.\nKayn will automatically emerge when attached to a  clone that expires.\nIf Kayn dies while  attached and the recast is available, Umbral Trespass'  damage is dealt immediately. If the recast is not available, Umbral Trespass'  damage is not dealt at all.\nEntering  resurrection while  attached does not deal Umbral Trespass'  damage regardless of if the recast is available or not. Kayn will still detach in this case.\nDuring Umbral Trespass, Kayn will not take the self-inflicted damage from  Death's Dance's Ignore Pain.\nAs  Rhaast, Umbral Trespass will not  heal if the target dies during the 0.75-second delay before emerging.\nUmbral Trespass'  interactions with  crowd control:\nBeing  stunned or  silenced or falling  asleep while  attached will cause the ability to recast automatically (even during the 0.75-second delay before Kayn is able to recast after attaching).\nUmbral Trespass  cleanses Kayn from  drowsiness.\nKayn is immune to  fear during Umbral Trespass.\n Roots will not prevent Kayn from initiating the recast.\n Displacements cannot interrupt the initial dash and neither can they apply while Kayn is attached. If the airborne source applies a  debuff, Kayn attaches to his target immediately, ending the dash prematurely in the process. The debuff is also removed instantly.\nUntil the recast or after the duration, the ability will have had no effect on the target for the purposes of  Electrocute or the 'in-combat' status.\n Spell shields will prevent Kayn from infesting the target, but will do nothing to mitigate the recast when used once he has already infested them.\nIf Kayn targets an enemy that is currently being protected by a spell shield, the ability will simply go on cooldown without making him infest his target.\nThis is also true for  Fiora's  Riposte.\nUmbral Trespass cannot be cast on targetable  zombie states such as  Sion during  Glory in Death.\nThe damage is not blocked if the target becomes  untargetable.\nKayn will copy his target's total size for Umbral Trespass'  duration, even if their size is smaller than his.\nThe screen will direct to the target's position upon attaching.\nAs  Rhaast, an alternate icon is used for the initial activation of  Umbral Trespass.",
