Additional damage effects, such as  on-hits, are not.\nIf casted beforehand, both the damage and the heal occurs even after Warwick's  death, or during  resurrection.\nIt has been special cased so Warwick will specifically not follow an enemy's  Recall, or  Sion when reviving from  Glory in Death (before dealing damage).\nJaws of the Beast's channel cannot be initiated while  grounded or  rooted. Warwick can only use the normal cast.\nThe channel will not be interrupted by either of the two effects, despite the lock-on being a movement channel.\nThe bite always occurs after the same delay, however the time spent lunging does not, which depends based on the range Jaw of the Beast was cast away from the target, up to a lunge duration of 0.5 seconds.\nThe lunge duration does not affect the  lockout timer on, which is the same as the bite's delay.\nWarwick's lunge always places him to his attack range to the center of his target.\nWarwick's dash will place him up to the edge of his attack range from the target.\nInteractions & Other\n\nIn order to hit the cap, the target monster needs to have at least 1667 / 1786 / 1875 / 1945 / 2000 health.\nJaws of the Beast is the only ability in the game that combines  channeling with  displacement immunity. Every  interrupting crowd control effect that is not resisted by the displacement immunity will prematurely stop the  dash.\nThe bite can still occur if cast before the crowd control application, but Warwick cannot start channeling.\nAbilities that apply both  stun and  airborne at the same time cause Warwick to ignore the displacement, but prematurely stop the channel and the dash.\nThe only exception to this is  Sion's  Glory in Death.\nWarwick will follow enemies that move via  attachment effects but the lock-on will not be extended.\nWhile Jaws of the Beast does not use Quick Casting by default, click-and-hold is comparable to the input required to use  Bone Skewer or  Comet Spear. It does not accept two-click input (e.g. First Cast and Recast) that abilities like  Piercing Arrow or  Decimating Smash use in Standard Casting.\nWarwick will attempt to basic attack the target after a short delay.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Warwick is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nCharge channel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\n Primal Howl is usable.  Blood Hunt and  Infinite Duress are disabled.\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Turbo Chemtank  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Gargoyle Stoneplate  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nAll item-actives not specified above interrupt\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Cast-inhibiting effects\n\nKnown Issues\n\nJaws of the Beast will also refund its  cooldown if it kills the target after being held for exactly its bite delay. *\nThe ability can be shortly cast on a dead target, with the ability going on cooldown.*",

The first instance deals 2 hits and triggers the  on-hit and  on-attack effects once, while the second instance deals the remaining last hit.\nIf Warwick does not collide with a champion, he will slide a fixed distance past the maximum range during which he is no longer crowd control immune and unable to declare basic attacks or cast movement abilities, including  Flash, but being able to cast  Jaws of the Beast and  Blood Hunt, with the former also interrupting the slide.\nWarwick is able to cast  Primal Howl at any time during the dash.\nThe dash will be interrupted instantly if an enemy champion  blinks in close proximity of Warwick.*\nEach hit counts as a separate hit for effects such as  Electrocute and  Eclipse's Ever Rising Moon.\nWarwick gains the  cc-immunity at the start of the cast time.\n Cleansing the  suppression does not interrupt the  channel and Warwick will continue to strike but not deal any damage.\nInfinite Duress is special cased to have its channel interrupted by  Fate's Call and  Devour if they affect Warwick's target.\nIf the target is  crowd control immune or protected by  spell shield upon collision, Warwick will not start the  channel.\nIf the target is in a  zombie state, Warwick will stop the channel after ~0.5 seconds of hitting them.\nInfinite Duress covers Warwick's hitbox, meaning he will collide with enemy champions that are particularly close to him.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Warwick is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Turbo Chemtank  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Gargoyle Stoneplate  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Cast-inhibiting effects",
