However, their duration will still get reset.\nA Dark Sphere summoned very shortly before Unleashed Power will be used as one of the spheres that get thrown.\nDepending on how many spheres are on the map and how far away the enemy is upon casting Unleashed Power it is possible that Syndra would conjure the sphere behind her as if she was going to throw it, but she won't.\nUnleashed Power will not add a Sphere that Syndra is holding with Force of Will.\nSpheres that are being pushed by Scatter the Weak (normally ones that were made late during the push) will not get picked up for Unleashed Power.\n Spell shield will only block the damage of a single sphere.",
