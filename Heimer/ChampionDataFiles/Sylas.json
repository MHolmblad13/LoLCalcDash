        "notes": "Hijack's per target cooldown is indicated by a ring under recently targetted enemy champions, and is only visible to Sylas and each individual enemy.\nIf Sylas casts Hijack on a  clone, no ultimate is stolen and the ability will be placed on full cooldown.\nThis does not occur with  Sion's  Glory in Death, since he is a  zombie instead.\n Clones do not copy Hijack's target cooldown indicator, potentially revealing them to Sylas.\n Neeko's  Inherent Glamour does not hide her personal cooldown indicator, nor does she copy her allies'.\nIf the target  dies, becomes  untargetable, or Sylas loses  sight of them during Hijack's cast time, the ability cancels and does not go on cooldown or expend  mana.\nIf the same happens when casting an on-target stolen ability, the ability will instead cancel and go on cooldown.\nIf Hijack is intercepted by  Braum's  Unbreakable, Sylas will gain a copy of  Glacial Fissure instead and an on-target cooldown will be applied to him.\nIf  Braum has an on-target cooldown on him (by being previously Hijacked) upon interception, no ultimate will be stolen.\nSince the copied ability scales based on Hijack's rank, abilities can be copied regardless of their rank.\nHijack will copy all components of the ability: their passives and actives as well as recast effects. Hijack will not trigger the effects of other abilities unless absolutely necessary.\nShape-shifting ultimates will transform Sylas into the target's alternate form, replacing his basic abilities and base stats. Namely:  Cougar Form,  Spider Form,  Cannon Form and  Dragon Form.\nDragon's Descent transforms Sylas'  mana, into Shyvana's  fury, being able to replenishing it by basic attacking. At the end of the effect, Sylas gains his previous mana.\nDragon's Descent does not refresh ability cooldowns upon transforming.\nUpon transforming back from  Cannon Form, Sylas' next basic attack deals  Transform Mercury Hammer's bonus magic damage and uses his critical strike animation.\nPermanent transformations last for ~5 minutes or until toggled off.\nThe alternate abilities of transforming champions will cost mana and scale with the ranks as appropriate for the ability (e.g. ranks in R for Nidalee and ranks in Q/W/E for Jayce/Elise).\nUpon transforming, a  Petricite Burst stack will be deducted.\n Petricite Burst stacks will still be gained from abilities cast in alternate forms, but the stacks are gained independently from the normal ones.\nIf Sylas has both normal and transformed stacks, Petricite Burst will prioritize consuming Sylas stacks before the transformed ones.\nUltimates comply with  One for All rules if an ally is playing the hijacked champion. For example, an allied  Darius'  Hemorrhage stacks will increase the damage of the hijacked  Noxian Guillotine; or an allied  Syndra's  Dark Sphere will add extra damage to hijacked  Unleashed Power as well as producing 3 spheres that she can use.\nInteractions\n Amumu's  Curse of the Sad Mummy - Does not apply  Cursed Touch.\n Aphelios'  Moonlight Vigil - Based on the  main weapon at the moment of steal.\n Crescendum empowers his basic attacks temporarily.\n Calibrum does not apply marks.\n Ashe's  Enchanted Crystal Arrow - Does not apply  Frost Shot to secondary targets.\n Brand's  Pyroclasm - Does not apply stacks of  Blaze.\n Cho'Gath's  Feast - Gains permanent Feast stacks on-kill.\n Corki's  Missile Barrage - Gains max charges.\n Darius'  Noxian Guillotine - Does not apply a stack of  Hemorrhage.\n Dr. Mundo's  Sadism - Retains the health cost.\n Fiora's  Grand Challenge - Gains movement speed in the effect and can trigger the area healing, but  Vitals do not deal bonus damage.\n Galio's  Hero's Entrance - Gives Sylas and allies  Shield of Durand's magic  shield, based on  Kingslayer rank.\n Gangplank's  Cannon Barrage - Does not steal cannon upgrades.\n Gnar's  GNAR! - Gains a usable ultimate regardless of cast on  Mini Gnar or  Mega Gnar.\n Heimerdinger's  UPGRADE!!! - Sylas's basic abilities are replaced with Heimerdinger's empowered abilities. The upgrade buff lasts until the ultimate can be stolen again.\n Illaoi's  Leap of Faith - Does not reduce  cooldown of  Kingslayer.\n Irelia's  Vanguard's Edge - Applies marks of  Bladesurge.\n Jax's  Grandmaster's Might - Applies magic damage on-hit while holding onto Grandmaster's Might, this effect is lost upon activation.\n Kassadin's  Riftwalk - Only provides one use.\n Kai'Sa's  Killer Instinct - Sylas' basic attacks,  Abduct and nearby allies'  immobilizations apply stacks of  Plasma, up to 4. Sylas is unable to apply the 5th stack necessary to expunge the stacks.\n Kalista's  Fate's Call - Only castable with a  link (purchasable in the Shop for  0 gold).\n Karma's  Mantra - Sylas' basic abilities are replaced with Karma's empowered abilities, according to Sylas' own ability ranks (including Hijack for Mantra bonuses).\n Katarina's  Death Lotus - Can be cast without a target.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass - Based on current form ( Shadow Assassin/ Rhaast).\n Kha'Zix's  Void Assault - Can steal the ability's  evolution bonus effects.\n Kennen's  Slicing Maelstrom - Applies  Mark of the Storm.\n Kled's  Chaaaaaaaarge!!! - Does not need  mount to cast.\n Kog'Maw's  Living Artillery - Only provides one use.\n LeBlanc's  Mimic - Uses the empowered version of  LeBlanc's last cast basic ability. If she has not cast any spells,  Mimic Sigil of Malice is copied.\n Leona's  Solar Flare - Does not apply  Sunlight.\n Lillia's  Lilting Lullaby - Sylas' abilities apply  Dream-Laden Bough's mark but not the damage.\n Lucian's  The Culling - Can cast  Abscond and  Abduct freely during the channel.\n Lux's  Final Spark - Does not apply  Illumination.\n Master Yi's  Highlander - Kills reduce basic ability cooldowns while holding onto Highlander, this effect is lost upon activation.\n Mordekaiser's  Realm of Death - Can join the dimension of outgoing realms if cast in the proper range (does not extend their duration).\n Nasus'  Fury of the Sands - Does not reduce  cooldown of  Chain Lash.\n Neeko's  Inherent Glamour - Always steals  Pop Blossom, regardless of the champion Neeko is disguised as.\n Olaf's  Ragnarok - Does not grant AD based on Sylas' AP, despite the tooltip indicating so.\n Orianna's  Command: Shockwave - Cast on self without a  ball.\n Pantheon's  Grand Starfall - The spear deals damage based on  Chain Lash rank and scales with 46% AP.\n Quinn's  Behind Enemy Lines - Does not cast  Skystrike upon attacking an enemy champion. It can be casted manually however.\n Rengar's  Thrill of the Hunt - Sylas will gain  Unseen Predator on his next attack.\n Renekton's  Dominus - Grants Sylas 20 mana on cast and then 5 mana per second (up to 75 total mana over the duration).\n Rek'Sai's  Void Rush - Sylas' attacks against enemy champions will apply a  mark which can be used to cast the ability.\n Riven's  Blade of the Exile - Grants AD based on Sylas' AP on cast.\n Samira's  Inferno Trigger - Can use without a  Grade.\n Seraphine's  Encore - Allies do not gain  Notes.\n Shyvana's  Dragon's Descent - Has a 200 second base cooldown.\n Skarner's  Impale - Can freely cast abilities during the suppression, but cannot basic attack or flash.\n Sylas'  Hijack - Steals the ability that the enemy Sylas has stolen. Cannot be targeted if no ability has been stolen.\n Syndra's  Unleashed Power - Throws a minimum of 3  spheres, which are left on the ground afterwards and vanish after 6 seconds.\n Talon's  Shadow Assault - Does not apply  Blade's End.\n Teemo's  Noxious Trap - Gains max charges.\n Tristana's  Buster Shot - Always has 525 cast range as Sylas does not benefit from  Draw a Bead's per-level cast range increase.\n Twitch's  Spray and Pray - Gains 300 attack range and his attacks produce missiles that travel 850 range. These attacks are classified as  melee, and so will trigger effects such as  Tiamat versus all hit targets.\n Udyr - Steals  Phoenix Stance. Lasts for 2 empowered attacks.\n Urgot's  Fear Beyond Death - Can cast  Kingslayer during the recast.\n Varus'  Chain of Corruption - Applies stacks of  Blight to targets hit that can be detonated by Sylas' other abilities, dealing damage based on  Kingslayer rank.\n Vayne's  Final Hour - Gains the AD and MS bonuses. Additionally, Sylas gains  invisibility when he casts  Chain Lash.\n Vel'Koz's  Life Form Disintegration Ray - Does not apply  Organic Deconstruction.\n Viego's  Sovereign's Domination - Always steals  Heartbreaker, regardless of the champion Viego is possessing.\n Viktor's  Chaos Storm - Can steal the ability's  evolution bonus effects.\n Xayah's  Featherstorm -  Feathers do not interact with an ally or enemy  Xayah.\n Yasuo's  Last Breath -  Critical strikes ignore 50% of the target's  bonus armor after activation.\n Yuumi's  Final Chapter - Can freely cast abilities during the channel.\n Zac's  Let's Bounce! - Cannot declare attacks nor use any abilities nor while bouncing. Drops  chunks that can be interacted with but do not restore health to Sylas.\n Zed's  Death Mark -  Shadow does not mimic spells but can be reactivated to  swap places.",
